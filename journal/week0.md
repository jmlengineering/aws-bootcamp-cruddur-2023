## Summary
This week was a refresh of AWS IAM and Budgets. The biggest difficulties for me came we changing the access permissions to allow Billing and Budget use for my IAM user as well as an integration problem with Gitpod and Github that delayed the AWS CLI installation. The tasks completed for the Budgets was an expansion of my knowledge. Using the AWS CLI to set up a budget, notifications, and SNS (a snippet shown below) was great to learn. I finished all the videos for this week. I did enjoy learning about diagramming on the conceptual and logical levels. Moving forward to week 1!
